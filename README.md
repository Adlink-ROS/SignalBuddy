# SignalBuddy

`SignalBuddy` is an easy-to-make, easy-to-use signal generator. Making friends is hard, but making `SignalBuddy` is easy - all you need is an Arduino Uno! Little to no soldering is required. `SignalBuddy` replaces more complicated and (much) more expensive signal generators in laboratory settings where one millisecond resolution is sufficient. `SignalBuddy` can:

* generate **sin waves**, **step functions**, and **pulse trains**
* generate **digital** and **PWM** signals, in addition to **true analog** signals when used with the optional [MCP4725 Chip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/935)  
* be controlled with an intuitive serial monitor interface
* look fabulous is a 3D printed enclosure
